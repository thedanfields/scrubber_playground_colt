### Introduction to a factory pattern:
Add the appropriate code to the [HeroRecordFactory.cs](https://github.com/thedanfields/scrubber_playground_colt/blob/master/scrubber_playground/file_parsers/hero/HeroRecordFactory.cs) to get the [tests](https://github.com/thedanfields/scrubber_playground_colt/blob/master/fileparser.tests.unit/HeroRecordFactoryTests.cs) to pass.

#### Bonus task:  
Modify the code so that the reflection operations in the HeroRecordFactory.cs are cached and only execute once per test.
